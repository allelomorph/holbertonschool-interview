## Mandatory Tasks

### :white_large_square: 0. Rain
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of walls with unit width 1, as if viewing the cross-section of a relief map, calculate how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.

* Prototype: `def rain(walls)`
* `walls` is a list of non-negative integers.
* Return: Integer indicating total amount of rainwater retained.
* Assume that the ends of the list (before index 0 and after index `walls[-1]`) are **not** walls, meaning they will not retain water.
* If the list is empty return 0.
