## Mandatory Tasks

### :white_check_mark: 0. Sandpiles sum
Write a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles

* Prototype: `void sandpiles_sum(int grid1[3][3], int grid2[3][3]);`
* You can assume that both `grid1` and `grid2` are individually stable
* A sandpile is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains
* When your function is done, `grid1` must be stable
* `grid1` must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable
* Youâ€™re not allowed to allocate memory dynamically
