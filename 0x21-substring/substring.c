/**
 * find_substring - Finds all the possible substrings containing a list of

 *   of each word in `words` exactly once and without any intervening characters
 *
 * @s: string to scan
 * @words: array of words all substrings must be a concatenation of to be
 *   valid; all words in this array are the same length
 * @nb_words: number of elements in the array words
 * @n: holds the address at which to store the number of elements in the returned array.
 *
 * Return: an allocated array storing each index in s at which a substring was
 *   found, or NULL on failure
