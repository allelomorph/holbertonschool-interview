We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope](https://github.com/allelomorph/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x0C-more_malloc_free/101-mul.c) in [(223) 0x0C. C - More malloc, free](https://github.com/allelomorph/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x0C-more_malloc_free).

### Provided file(s)

## Mandatory Tasks

### :white_check_mark: 0. Infinite Multiplication
Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers:

* Usage: `mul num1 num2`
* `num1` and `num2` will be passed in base 10
* Print the result, followed by a new line
* If the number of arguments is incorrect, print `Error`, followed by a new line, and exit with a status of 98
* `num1` and `num2` should only be composed of digits. If not, print `Error`, followed by a new line, and exit with a status of 98
* You are allowed to use more than 5 functions in your file

You can use `bc` (`man bc`) to check your results.

File(s): [`0-mul.c`](./0-mul.c)\
Compiled: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 0-mul.c _putchar.c -o mul`
