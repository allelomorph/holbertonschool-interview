### Description
Practice interview question originally appearing as task [8. Heap sort](https://github.com/allelomorph/sorting_algorithms/blob/master/104-heap_sort.c) in [(248) 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O](https://github.com/allelomorph/sorting_algorithms).

### Provided file(s)
* [`print_array.c`](./print_array.c)
* [`0-main.c`](./0-main.c)

## Mandatory Tasks

### :white_check_mark: 0. Heap sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm

* Prototype: `void heap_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
* You must implement the sift-down heap sort algorithm
* Youâ€™re expected to print the `array` after each time you swap two elements

Write in the file `0-O`, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Heap sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

* in the best case
* in the average case
* in the worst case

File(s): [`0-heap_sort.c`](./0-heap_sort.c) [`0-O`](./0-O)\
Compiled: `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-main.c 0-heap_sort.c print_array.c -o 0-heap`
